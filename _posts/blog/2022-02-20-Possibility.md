Still remember the morning, the time a woman picked up a telephone and start the conversation. After the call ended turned out it was a bad news, without any good news.

This past month I have a though, sometimes followed by a strage dream in night, perhaps I could say it was a nightmare. Though It do not disturb my daily activity ~~a lot~~, but the vision easily came back when im not doing anything.

..

Then I realize that I need to seek for professional help. 

>Solving the problem is one thing, admit you have a problem is another thing.

Used chat feature in one of telemedicine app. With 30k IDR I booked 40mins session with psyhiciater. Felt strange at first to tell the stories to stranger at the moment (but we are stranger for everyone right). From quora i've read tips to write your story first in blank text page so when the session ready you could easily copy and paste to the chat box.

40 minutes passed by, the psyhiciater provides notes based on the conversation. The irony is I expected all the notes she gave, and all of them is correct. She really know to press where its hurts.


Which leads to, the rest is up to me.
