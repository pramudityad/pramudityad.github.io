Insired from tech Youtuber i create sort of my current apps in my phone. Not all apps will be state in here. Just some apps that really i use everyday
 
1. Adguard : i really like to have ad-blocking apps in my phone, although the use is not really good as it in Android but it feel usefull to block some tracker or ads. And i subscribe to yealry plan to use is DNS service.

2. Air visual : live in Jakarta and work in Tangerang with many air pollution i think its necessary to have air quality monitoring apps. This is one of my go to app after woke up.

3. Carousel : i love this app as my go to when i want to sell my things. free to use haha.

4. Dime : money tracker app is usefull when you move into new town, and you want to track expense. Dime give friendly interface and they don't track your data.

5. Maps : Traffic is my enemy. So i usually spend little amount of time before i going outside and monitor the traffic. Gmaps is my friend for this kind of things, not really big fans of Apple Maps.

6. Banking : BCA, Mandiri, Gopay. I want to reduce to only BCA but its hard since my workplace use Mandiri as Payroll.

7. Hevy : is workout tracker application, since 2022 i try to build habbit to workout at least 3 times a week and this app realy usefull for me. It has premium subscription where you can have unlimited workout routine.

8. Hiya : is callblocking app, in this dayu where telemarketer is very agressive we need to protect ourself from it. I switch to Hiya from previous app due to privacy issue.
 
9. Social Media : i use X formerly (twitter), Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit and Fomo. Hopefully i never want to use Tiktok haha

10. Tokopedia : last but not least. Tokopedia is marketplace application, i tread this app as secondary social media.
