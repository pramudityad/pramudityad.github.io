### ‚õ∞ What It's About
This book talking about habbit, behaviour and everything in between

### üîç How I Discovered It
Joining group in telegram, i already saw this book a 4 couple months back then. So its always haunting me, after hold in CPL. I got notification this book already available, then i go for it.

### üß† Thoughts
After finishing this book, i think its beyond the title itself. And i really like the kind of books that have chapter summary, just in case someone who feel exaust to read the whole chapter, they can always go for summary. 

For me i always go chapter 1st, and go back to prologue in each chapter.

### ü•∞ Who Would Like It?
I would say, a person that cannot go a day without checking (get things done). or person who very disipline maybe, or a person currently building a habbit system.

### [[Most valueable quote]]
>Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
