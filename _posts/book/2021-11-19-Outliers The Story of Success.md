### ‚õ∞ What It's About
He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing.

### üîç How I Discovered It
I already have this book in my Kindle, and have read couple pages. But, I realize everyone speak about this book a lot, then I have a tought to borrow the original one from Libby. 


### üß† Thoughts
When i think about Malcolm Gladwell the first come into my mind will be this book, he's arguing smart people don't automatically become successful, they do so because they got lucky. This rule applies to everyone including the likes of Bill Gates and Robert Oppenheimer. That's it. That's what the whole book is about. Gladwell looks at case after case of this: Canadian hockey players, Korean airline pilots, poor kids in the Bronx, Jewish lawyers, etc... Even with all this evidence it feels like he's pulling in examples that fit his theory


### ü•∞ Who Would Like It?
I originally thought this to be a self-improvement kind of book, but quickly figured that's not the case, then may be some sort of a business development one, which also fell apart quickly. I cannot round off this any closer than to some kind of a sociology - psychology combo. So if anyone into skepticism this would be a good read

Biologists often talk about the ‚Äúecology‚Äù of an organism: the tallest oak in the forest is the tallest not just because it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a sapling, and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured.

If you make a decision about who is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the ‚Äútalented‚Äù from the ‚Äúuntalented‚Äù; and if you provide the ‚Äútalented‚Äù with a superior experience, then you‚Äôre going to end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.
