### ⛰ What It's About
This book talking about habbit, behaviour and everything in between

### 🔍 How I Discovered It
Joining group in telegram, i already saw this book a 4 couple months back then. So its always haunting me, after hold in CPL. I got notification this book already available, then i go for it.

### 🧠 Thoughts
After finishing this book, i think its beyond the title itself. And i really like the kind of books that have chapter summary, just in case someone who feel exaust to read the whole chapter, they can always go for summary. 

For me i always go chapter 1st, and go back to prologue in each chapter.

### 🥰 Who Would Like It?
I would say, a person that cannot go a day without checking (get things done). or person who very disipline maybe, or a person currently building a habbit system.

### [[Most valueable quote]]
>Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

“When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.

The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how often they exercised. The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise.
