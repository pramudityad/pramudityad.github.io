### ‚õ∞ What It's About
Author talks about real life instances where computer algorithms can be applied. It covers topics like optimal stopping, explore/exploit, caching, scheduling, bayes rule, overfitting, randomness, networking, game theory etc. For people who are computer science professionals this would be a easy read, may not be so for others.

### üîç How I Discovered It
Found in twitter and recommendation tab from Amazon

### üß† Thoughts
I‚Äôve been waiting for a book to come along that merges computational models with human psychology.

I've always done the things mentioned in the book intuitively, without even realizing, but making a framework out of it would've been challenging and time consuming (since a lot of math is involved, which the authors have already done for me).

### ü•∞ Who Would Like It?
A perso who involved in Tech industry would love it. or Geeks
