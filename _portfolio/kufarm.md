In this is research made of
agricultural system with the
concept of automation named
kufarm, the system created
have a 'Decision Making
Algorithm'. The system can
predict when the soil used as
a planting medium will
experience dry so it needs to
watering by doing
consideration of the
parameters that have been
set and system that has been
created can work on outdoor.

### Specifications
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, sensors ( soil, humidity, temperature and rain) , DC pump, Relay
for watering system and PHP, HTML, flask, SQLite for monitoring system. For this project i
used Python 3.5.2

### Milestones
- Project proposal
Early stage is made proposal about my project which conclude of design, purpose,
requirements and the methods are used in this project
- Development
In development stage is where i build the system (hardware and software) until final
condition is fulfilled
- Guidance from lecturer(s)
In meantime, iâ€™ve got guidance from my lectures.
